				<b>Last Updated: August 26, 2019</b>
				<p>
					TrustScore. (referred to as “we” or “our”) is sensitive to privacy issues. The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to let you know how we handle the information we receive from you or your web browser through this website. This Privacy Policy applies to the information we collect from the TrustScore website, located at www.trustscore.in (collectively, the “Site”), and to information you otherwise provide directly to us. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the data processed through the authentication services we provide to our end customers.
					We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our Site homepage). We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access the Site to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy.
					Our role doesn’t just go as far as information collection; we are also entrusted to ensure the security and privacy of the collected data.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>TrustScore Clients:</b>
					Our Clients are enterprises, companies, institutions, and businesses that have opted for our Services. The information we collect from the Clients includes their Full Name, Company Email, Phone Number and any other information required to set up their accounts, with reference to the Services they select, and the End-users they wish to verify.
					Depending on the type of verification process selected, i.e. onsite or offsite, the data is collected directly from the End-users or the Clients. In case if it is from the Clients, they take the information and image and video proofs from the End-users and pass the data to us via the API. TrustScore will verify only the information that has been provided by the End-users. In case the Clients don’t provide certain information required for the selected services, the missing information is collected from the End-users via OCR technology. They End-users will be asked to show their documents in real-time so relevant information may be extracted from them. Furthermore, if the End-user fails a certain check, the verification process ends. This is to ensure that the Client’s verification balance is not wasted if the End-user is not verified.
					The legal basis for this processing is the performance of a contract between you and us and/or taking steps, at your request, to enter into such a contract.
